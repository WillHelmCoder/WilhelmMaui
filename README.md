# 🧪 .NET MAUI Educational & Template Projects

Welcome to this educational repository designed to help developers learn how we structure, develop, and reuse code in **.NET MAUI**.

This repository serves two main purposes:

- 🎓 **Educational Reference** – Showcasing patterns, features, and experiments with clean and simple examples.
- 🧰 **Template Library** – Providing usable, documented starter templates to bootstrap real-world MAUI applications.

## 📁 Project Naming Convention

Each project is prefixed with:

- `w` – Stands for "**workshop**" or "**walkthrough**", meaning it’s part of this educational series (Is not from Will <-- hahahaha).
- A 3-digit number (e.g., `w001`, `w002`, `w010`) – To organize and keep projects sequentially ordered.
- Optional `-T#` – Denotes **Template** projects ready to reuse as a starting point.

## 🏷️ Project Types

| Prefix     | Meaning                                     |

## 📚 ADR Documentation

Some projects include [Architecture Decision Records](./ADR) to explain why specific patterns or implementations were chosen. Use them as guides to adapt the architecture in your own work.

---

## 💡 How to Use

- Browse the projects folder.
- Read the included `README.md` or ADRs inside each project if available.
- Copy or clone Template (`-T#`) projects when starting your own app.
- Reuse snippets, patterns, and ideas freely.
